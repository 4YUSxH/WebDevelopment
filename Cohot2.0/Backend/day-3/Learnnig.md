RESTfuL APIs -> It is a protocol and defination for using API, If any application is using rest api there is only checks to paas 1. it is surely using HTTP or HTTPS protocol, 2. It is surely using HTTP Methdos e.g. GET, POST, Etc

HTTP Mehtods -> It defines actions you want to perform on a resource
                POST : Create resource on a server/backend, and resources created by user/client/frontend 
                GET : Sending a resource to client
                PUT : Update a created resource on server 
                PATCH : Partially(Small Piece) Update the created resource on server
                DELETE : Delete a resource on server
