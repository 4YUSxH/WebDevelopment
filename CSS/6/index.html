<!-- 
Cascade algo: compute which property will be applied 
1.> Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear(when selectors are same types)
2.> Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match(Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector)
3.> Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS
4.> Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type
-->

<!-- 
Specificity Calculation:
    ->Universal Selector: 0
    ->Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1
    ->Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10
    ->ID selectors: 100
    ->Inline styles: 1000

Ex:
    a.zoroclass.naruto-class[href]:hover  ->Specificity: 1(element selector) +10(class selector) +10(class selector) +10(attribute selector) +10(pseudo selector) =41
    {
    color: red;
    }
